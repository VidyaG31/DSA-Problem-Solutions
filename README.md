# DSA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems, implementing multiple approaches for each problem.

## Problem Solving Approach

For each problem, I implement three approaches:

### 1. Brute Force Approach
- Initial straightforward solution
- Usually higher time complexity
- Serves as a starting point for optimization

### 2. Better Approach
- Improved solution with better time/space complexity
- Often involves some optimization or better algorithm selection

### 3. Optimal Approach
- Most efficient solution
- Best possible time and space complexity
- Often uses advanced techniques or insights
